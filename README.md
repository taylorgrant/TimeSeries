Functions and scripts for time series analysis. Primarily interested in fractional integration. 

arfimaSim: simulates (p,d,q) series of length N.

MC_FIunitRoot: Monte Carlo simulation investigating FI confound of unit root tests. 

whittleFML.R: estimates ARFIMA (p,d,q) in frequency domain using MLE, see (https://goo.gl/X3B0PA)

MC_whittleFML: function to run Monte Carlo simulation of whittleFML with various (p,d,q)
